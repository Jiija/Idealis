# Idealis
Comprehensive collaboration system

Idealis workflow:

1. Idea Creation: Users can write down their ideas, which become nodes in the system. The idea description is a necessary component of each node.

2. Pre-processing: Some pre-processing is conducted to remove non-serious or destructive ideas, ensuring that the discussions remain focused on viable concepts.

3. User Comments and Actions: Other users are invited to comment on the idea. They have three available actions: expound, delineate problems, or delineate potential profit/benefit. Each action creates a sub-node, which serves as a discussion thread for that specific topic.

4. Feasibility Assessment: After sufficient discussion has taken place, the idea is evaluated to determine its feasibility. This assessment considers the insights, perspectives, and feedback shared within the discussion threads.

5. Memetic Credits: A special algorithm rewards each participant with memetic credits based on their contributions to the discussion. Participants have the option to either cash out their credits, exchanging them for energy credits, or become stakeholders in the idea.

6. Idea Implementation Team: Stakeholders who choose not to cash out their memetic credits become part of the "Idea Implementation Team." They contribute their credits to the "Idea Implementation Bank," which serves as a pool of resources for further development and implementation.

7. Public Investment: The idea is made public, allowing other users to invest their memetic credits and become memetic shareholders. This provides additional resources and support for the idea's implementation.

By implementing this system, Idealis encourages collaboration, discussion, and critical thinking around ideas. It rewards active participation and provides a mechanism for individuals to engage further by becoming stakeholders or memetic shareholders. This approach can facilitate the selection of promising ideas, the formation of dedicated teams, and the pooling of resources needed for successful implementation.
